Target user profile:
In general this CV is not focused on any specific user, so I have decided to make it with a generic design but acceptable for most areas.

Information architecture: 
I have decided to divide the information into two clearly differentiated blocks. In the colored strip on the left, we can find the most generic and contact information. On the right side we would find more specific information such as a description, studies and experience.

Visual design: 
It has a simple and formal design, in which it is easy to see and distinguish the different sections.
